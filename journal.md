## Total Time Spent on the Project: **56 hours**

---

## ðŸ—“ 26/6 â€“ 8 hours  
- Sketched out the four-chamber airflow design on paper.  
- Researched appropriate filtration methods using coffee grounds and compatible neutralizers like NHâ‚ƒ and ZnClâ‚‚.  
- Identified components needed for each chamber's function and created a functional flow outline.  
- Selected Raspberry Pi 5 and HAT to support multiple sensors and I/O control.

## ðŸ—“ 27/6 â€“ 8 hours  
- Began CAD modeling of the external enclosure using Fusion 360.  
- Created chamber cutouts with airflow paths, modeled fans, filters, and chemical scrubber holders.  
- Added placeholders for sensors and wiring channels.  
- Evaluated airflow simulations and adjusted internal channel diameters.

## ðŸ—“ 28/6 â€“ 7 hours  
- Continued refining the CAD model.  
- Modeled mount points for Raspberry Pi and fans inside the waterproof housing.  
- Added slots for the LCD screen and external power switch access.  
- Generated first rendered image of the full 3D unit.  
- Printed basic prototype casing (not functional) for scale check.

## ðŸ—“ 29/6 â€“ 6 hours  
- Prototyped wiring layout based on sensor locations inside the chamber model.  
- Experimented with servo positioning for air diversion between chambers.  
- Tested Raspberry Pi GPIO compatibility with selected servo valve.

## ðŸ—“ 30/6 â€“ 8 hours  
- Finalized the 3D CAD model.  
- Generated exploded view and section views for documentation.  
- Worked on sensor mounting clips inside the model.  
- Started design export into STL and DXF for fabrication.

## ðŸ—“ 1/7 â€“ 8 hours  
- Simulated chemical flow interaction using different inner surfaces in the third chamber.
- drived 2 equations to ensure the effiecency of the selected activation method
- Integrated brackets for coffee grounds and ZnClâ‚‚ filters.  
- Created safety seal zones in the model for the ammonia chamber.  
- Documented CAD specifications in notes and saved design versions.

## ðŸ—“ 2/7 â€“ 7 hours  
- Created high-res render of the full model for use in README.  
- Finalized assembly layout including fasteners and cable glands.  
- Cross-referenced with BOM to ensure parts match design.

## ðŸ—“ 3/7 â€“ 4 hours  
- Assembled all documentation: BOM CSV, README with all image links, journal logs. 
- Uploaded images, model screenshots, and wiring diagram to the GitHub repo.  
- Final formatting and proofing of README.md and journal.md for requirement compliance.  
- Performed last round of link testing and completeness check on project folder.
